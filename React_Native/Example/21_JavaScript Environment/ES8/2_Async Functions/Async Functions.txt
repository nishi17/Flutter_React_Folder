Awaiting Non-Promise
When the value passed to await is a Promise, 
the completion of the async function is scheduled on completion of the Promise. 
For non-promises, behaviour aligns with Promise conversion rules according to the proposed semantic polyfill.

Surface syntax
Instead of async function/await, the following are options:

function^/await
function!/yield
function!/await
function^/yield
