Make sure all interactive elements are 44x44 or larger.
 One way to do this is to leave enough space for the element, padding,
 minWidth and minHeight style values can be useful for that. Alternatively,
 you can use hitSlop prop to increase interactive area withoust affecting the layout. 



 <TouchableOpacity
          hitSlop={{ top: 20, bottom: 20, left: 150, right: 50 }}
        >
          <Button title="sign in "> </Button>
        </TouchableOpacity>
