By default, iOS will block any request that's not encrypted using SSL. 
If you need to fetch from a cleartext URL (one that begins with http) you will first need to 
add an App Transport Security exception.

If you know ahead of time what domains you will need access to, it is more secure to add exceptions just for those domains; 
if the domains are not known until runtime you can 
disable ATS completely.

Note however that from January 2017, 
Apple's App Store review will require reasonable justification for disabling ATS.
